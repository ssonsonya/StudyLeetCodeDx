# ðŸ¦¾Study LeetCode using C++ & DirectX

## Study as playing a gameðŸš€

*cuz my main goal is to create an awesome game by myself*  
Will try my best to show **visually** how Data Structures and Algorithms work while solving LeetCode Problems or maybe other interesting code challenges.  

```cpp
  do
  {
    Learn();
    Record();
    Use();
  } while( me.status == gameDev );
```

## Branch Structure

01. Main : Master branch that other branches merge in  
02. Solution : Solutions of LeetCode questions  
03. Visualize : Process of Visualizing solutions  
04. Framework : codes about DX Frameworks and utilities  
~  
and so on...

## Commit Rules  

Title : Main Updates

1. List all the updated source files under :  
    [ Update ] or [ New ] or [ Delete ] or etc..  
2. Comment details about changes if needed

Example )
```c++
[ Problem #1768 ] Solution   // Title
[ New ]       // List of newly added source files
 - LC1768
[ Update ]    // List of updated source files
 - UI/Button
```

## Code Convention
| Syntax | Style | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variable | camelCase | tempVar |
| boolean variable| is + PascalCase | isCorrect |
| Class member variable | m_ + camelCase | m_memVar |
| Global variable | g_ + camelCase | g_handle |
| Function | PascalCase | SetTarget() |
| Struct | PascalCase | PlayerStat |
| Enum | UPPER_CASE | APPLE, GRAPE, ORANGE |
| Class | PascalCase | class Question |
| Macro | UPPER_CASE | SAFE_RELEASE(tempVar) |
